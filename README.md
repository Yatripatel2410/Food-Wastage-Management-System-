# Food-Wastage-Management-System:
Food wastage is a significant issue, with many households and restaurants discarding surplus food while numerous people struggle with food insecurity. This project aims to develop a Local Food Wastage Management System, where:
Restaurants and individuals can list surplus food.
NGOs or individuals in need can claim the food.
SQL stores available food details and locations.
A Streamlit app enables interaction, filtering, CRUD operation and visualization.
